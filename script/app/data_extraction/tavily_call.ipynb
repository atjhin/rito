Originally a normal girl from the foothills of Mount Targon thousands of years ago, she caught the attention of a celestial Aspect due to her mischievous and playful nature. This Aspect, delighted by Zoe's carefree exuberance, offered her a chance to see the universe by opening a portal to the apex of Mount Targon. Zoe accepted and traveled to the stars, where she encountered the cosmic dragon Aurelion Sol. Now, as the Aspect of Twilight, Zoe possesses immense magical power, including the ability to create destructive comets and travel across the universe using portals. Despite her appearance as a young girl, she is one of the oldest champions in the League of Legends lore, born between 550 BN and 400 BN, making her essentially a god-like entity.\n"
